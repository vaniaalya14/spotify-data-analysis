## Problem Identification
The primary goal of this project is to identify trends and patterns in Spotify's music data to help production users make informed decisions. This includes understanding user preferences, popular genres, and key factors influencing song popularity.

## Data Loading
The data used in this project is sourced from Spotify's API and public datasets. The data includes various attributes of songs such as track name, artist, genre, popularity, danceability, energy, and more.

### Steps to Load Data
1. Set up the Spotify API credentials.
2. Fetch the data using the API or download from public datasets.
3. Save the data in a suitable format (e.g., CSV).

## Data Cleaning
Data is cleansed from data duplication and changing it's incorrect data types.

## Data Visualization
The data visualization is also created in the Tableau and can be seen in this link : https://public.tableau.com/views/Milestone1-Spotify/DatViz?:language=en-US&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link

## Conclusion
To boost music quality and increase song popularity, focus on key audio features: danceability, energy, speechiness, acousticness, and instrumentalness. These features are trending upwards. Electropop is the leading subgenre, and albums are more popular than singles. With 58 songs released annually, market availability has little impact on popularity.
